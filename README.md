# YurtsDBchap6pursue

PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide (5th Edition)
Written by Larry Ullman

Complete the following from the 6th chapter's Pursue section:

Design your own database that can support a reservation for yurts at Pacific Trails Resort. Each table must be in the 3NF:

1. Yurts are booked by nights. The user will pick a check-in and check-out date. There are several yurts, and each yurt has unique features, such as: how many beds, how many people maximum, smoking or not, pets or not, and a cost per night.

2. Customer info has to be tracked based upon the Customer's: firstname, lastname, email, and phone.

3. Need to be able to look up data to know whether a given yurt is available on a given date.

4. Need to be able to have a reservation for a given yurt for a given customer for a given date range.

Create the tables in PHPMyAdmin, and take a screenshot (hint: use the Designer tab to get an image of all tables and their connections).

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
